# Solving Utility Maximization Problems using Quantum Reinforcement Learning


*This project was submitted to QHack Open Hackathon 2022. (Team Name: DynamicQuantumWorld)*


In general markets, the competitive equilibrium, or more generally, Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) is characterized by a set of state variables and the consumption and production plans of each agent to maximize the utility. Such utility maximization problem has been traditionally dealt with Lagrangian methods. In this Hackathon project, we demonstrate **a quantum approach to solving utility maximization problem.** Specifically, we employed Quantum Reinforcement Learning to train the policy that determines the agent's actions.

### Packages
Qiskit, PyTorch, etc.

### Tutorial & Presentation
Tutorial is available [here](https://github.com/FinnyLime/Quantum-DSGE/blob/main/Utility%20Maximization%20with%20QRL.ipynb).

### Demonstration
To train the policy QNN which determine the actions of the agent, you can run the following:
```bash
python3 Utility_Maximization.py
```
